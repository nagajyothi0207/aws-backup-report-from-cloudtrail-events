- Uploads the report to an S3 bucket.
- Sends an SNS notification with the report location.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate permissions to run Lambda functions, access S3 buckets, and publish SNS notifications.
- Python 3.x installed locally for testing and deployment.
- AWS CLI configured with credentials.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

3. Update environment variables in `lambda_function.py`:
